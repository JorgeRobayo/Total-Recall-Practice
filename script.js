//Assign: giving value after declaring a variable
//Define: giving a variable its initial data type

//5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?

//What is: Pseudocoding is a way to write a description of a computer program or  algorithm in plain english
//Why: We should use to simplify and planning the program in small logical steps. 


//6. What percentage of time should be spent
//thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?

//A reasonable amount spent in planning and solving the problem is 50-70%
//and for coding it takes about 50-30%
